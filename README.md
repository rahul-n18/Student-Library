  A One Stop Solution for Students<br>
 <h2 align="center"> ---------- An Idea ------------</h2>

<br>
<br>

<h2 align="left">Idea 💡: </h2>
<p align="left">My Idea is simple but I feel it is essential. I want to build an app which covers majority of the things that are required by a student for his Day to Day Life.
For example Instead for browsing an entire web for some book, we can have a library which provides him the book he needs. Not only that, An app which gives you latest Updates of Tech world,
An app that will help you in growing your career, An App which gives you Motiavtion and guides you to the path with which you can become a better Person and where Like minded people can Talk and Discuss about future and Tech.<p>

Hacktoberfest is an annual festival hosted by DigitalOcean that takes place in the month of October to celebrate the open source community. As part of this 31-day celebration, contributors and open source maintainers are encouraged to work on open source projects and win swag to mark the occasion.

#### Tips for Contributors:

- PRs beyond our open issues are welcome but make sure your contributions are meaningful and beneficial to other users otherwise your PR may be closed and marked as ‘invalid’.
- Issues before PRs. If you plan to make a contribution, please make sure there is an issue for it. You can either find an existing issue or open a new issue if none exists.
- You are welcome to make your first contribution to this repo.
